## Abstract 
In most organizations, the pursuit of reliability is often blended with obscurity. There is strict access control and sometimes this means relevant people not having access to even basic observability metrics. This leads to increased stress when systems go down, with people pointing fingers & assigning blame to things they may not fully understand. As a general rule of thumb, higher transparency not only results in a better incident management and response process but more importantly also increases trust between team members and gives them a way to calmly figure out what went wrong before fixing it for good. Here we outline how you can cultivate transparency in your team and benefit from it.

**Amiya Adwitiya**:     00:00          Hello everyone. My name is Amiya and I'm a founder of Squadcast. For those of you who don't know about Squadcast, it's a platform that helps you adopt SRE best practices, and kind of make sense of all of the noise that our SRE that everybody's talking about. So I'm talking about transparency and incident response, right? And this is really like what happens in most of the organizations, the list of people that you trust is very, very small. And this is just Sev1, for Sev0 that's probably no paper even in there. So the idea is that you want to trust people, and trust begins through understanding. Now in a lot of organizations there's a conception of reliability through obscurity, because the ideas of security and reliability are almost always conflated.

**Amiya Adwitiya**:     00:44          And in security, you have like access control authorization, so a lot of people don't even have access to a lot of observability metrics. But really reliability through transparency is the best way to do things because it helps you improve your metrics, improve your processes and also helps everybody understand what metrics you're really tracking. So there are really four levels of transparency that you can think about. The first level of transparency is internal, so engineering team you have like proudly status pages that are gated just for the engineering team. And by engineering team I mean like everybody was not technically challenged, right?

**Amiya Adwitiya**:     01:20          The next level of internal transparency across the entire org product teams, business teams, you have SLOs that your business teams are supposed to understand. And the next level of transparency is where you expose your incident management practices and your SLOs to external stakeholders, like your customers, vendors, or anybody that you're working with. And the next level of transparency is where you really bare all, you'd take it and it's kind of like you've seen companies that actually live stream outages, and I feel like that's the holy grail of transparency that they've gotten. And that's really a state where you can feel very confident about being in a place where your metrics are constantly improving, because you're being transparent about them. And for various metrics and events you want to choose what kind of transparency you want to go with, like for some things you just want to have it at internal transparency, A, you know? So you can choose where do you want, which level of transparency you want certain metrics or certain SLOs to be at.

**Amiya Adwitiya**:     02:21          Now transparency is really central to SRE, choosing SLIs, SLOs, it's like part art, part science. We all know that we probably don't choose the right SLI oftentimes. So if you really reveal this information across your team, so it's going to be easier because people will be able to understand whether these SLIs are the right SLIs or not. Then if you're transparent about your SLOs, you also have a better understanding of dependencies across these SLO. You could form better policies around area budgets and how these SLOs kind of interact with each other. And what I want you to take away from this is, for every organization you need to think about transparency in a more deliberate fashion, and you need to think about, "Okay, if I have a metric or if I have an SLO, what level of transparency is it going to be at?"

**Amiya Adwitiya**:     03:16          Busting some myths about transparency, just because you're transparent about something doesn't mean that other people get to have a say in it, it's just that you're communicating what you're doing to people across the organization. So it's not decision by committee, there's still probably only a few people that get to have a say on that. Explaining my SLOs, so people feel like things get really complicated if you have to be transparent about SLOs, but that's not really true because if you want to be transparent, you want to make it really simple that folks who are even not techies can understand. There's another myth that if you're transparent about everything, things get complicated because everybody has to understand stuff, but it's actually twice as fast because it removes all the blind spots in terms of the metrics that you're sharing.

**Amiya Adwitiya**:     03:58          So benefits of DevOps and SRE transparency, this is some of the things that you could probably get if you follow a transparent culture in your SRE organization. So at Squadcast actually we have this loop of doing incident management in the SRE way, and this actually helps you kind of develop operational transparency across your org. And you can choose like different levels of transparency for different metrics and events that you have. Lastly, you know this, you can trial Squadcast, shameless plug here, sorry about that. But you can try it out online, we have a coupon code for folks who are listening to this talk and whoever you want to share it with. So also we're right outside, so if you guys didn't get a t-shirt yet, there's a really cool SRE tee shirt, so please come by the booth and grab one. Yeah, that's pretty much it.
